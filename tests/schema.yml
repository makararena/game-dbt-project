    description: |
      Ensures no two sessions for the same player overlap in time.
      Fails if any pair of sessions (same player_id) has overlapping
      [session_start, session_end] ranges. Used to keep session
      attribution unambiguous (e.g. for fct_game_events).
    config:
      severity: error
      store_failures: true
